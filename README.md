# Workout Organizer

This is an app for people to organize and track their custom workouts! I know, a workout app, sooo original. In all honesty, I'm doing this as a way to keep coding in Rails and to learn. 

- Goal 1: Build app in Rails to just keep Rails info fresh. 
- Goal 2: Explore/learn Bootstrap and how I can use it to build a good looking front end. <- Currently on - this step 
- Goal 3: Learn and use JavaScript to add interactive features 
- Goal 5: Turn backend into a Rails API
- Goal 6: Learn React and build frontend
